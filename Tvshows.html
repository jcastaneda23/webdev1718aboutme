<p class= paraThree>This show has gone through a lot." Voltron was introduced to the world in 1984
with the animated TV program Voltron:Defender of the Universe. The show was actually a sanitized
edit of two unrelated Japanese anime series with much of the violence and Japanese cultural
conventionsremoved. Since the original airing, Voltron has stayed popular, spawning multiple
toylines,a 1990s CGI-animated series,and multiple comics series.Shout-outs to Voltron persist
in pop culture, and a live-action motion picture is in development. Come learn more about the
robot that is "loved by good, feared by evil"!"</p>

<li class="paraTwo"><a href="http://bakerstreet.wikia.com/wiki/Sherlock_(2010)" target="_blank"> Sherlock; BBC edition</a>
<p class="paraThree"> Sherlock Holmes is the infamous detective that we all grew up reading and watching films about.

some actor called Beeneditc Cumbervatch. (Yes, I missed spelled.)</p>

<!dan and phil>

<li class="paraTwo"><a href="https://youtube.com/user/DanAndPhilGAMES" target="_blank"> Dan and Phil </a>
<p class= "paraThree">These two British lads, are something else. They started their youtube channels
nearly a decade ago, I mean myspace was still the big thing. Now years later they have written a book
together, gone on tour, and other cool stuff. These guys, Dan(26) and Phil(30) are simple adults that
make money from teens watching them talk and simply tell their emberassing life stories which happen
to be incredibily relatable. They resently have live streams on youNow or on youtube, with a couple
video games in between. Plus get this, the fans since the pre-historic time, have yet to know if they
are just BFFLs or a couple.
If you want to know more about them individually, here are their personal youtubes;</p>
