    <h1 class="heading" style="border:2px solid #fcd874;">Art</h1>
    <p class="paraOne">Clicking the link to see art was a smart move. In fact Art is a lot of things, but also nothing. It is human emotion, but also just something that one can easily get rid off. What one forgets is that without any kind of art,
    let it be writing, music, paintings, even a photograph, we would be lost as humanity.</p>
    <p class="paraTwo"> Just for the sake of Art i will link you up with some incredible artist, and their art.</p>
